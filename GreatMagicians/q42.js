//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
function show_magicians(magicianNames) {
    magicianNames.forEach(function (magician) {
        console.log(magician);
    });
}
function make_great(magicians) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = "the Great ".concat(magicians[i]);
    }
}
var magicianNames = ["Bob", "Eric", "charlie", "John"];
make_great(magicianNames);
show_magicians(magicianNames);
